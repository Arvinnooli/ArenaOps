# Stadium Management System

This project encompasses a comprehensive stadium management system built using Flask. The system allows administrators to manage events, staff, and parking, providing a seamless experience for both staff and attendees.

Event Management: Admins can create, modify, and remove events, along with managing available seats and bookings.
Staff Management: A dedicated interface for staff management, enabling the addition, removal, and scheduling of staff shifts and types.
Parking System: The system handles parking management, including entry and exit functionalities, with real-time slot availability and customer tracking.
The project includes HTML pages, styled using CSS, and utilizes Flask's routing capabilities to create an intuitive and functional stadium management application.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Run the `database.sql` script to create the database schema.
2. Execute the `function_procedures_and_triggers.sql` script to create functions, procedures, and triggers.
3. Run `initialize_database.py` to populate the database with initial data.
4. Ensure you have Flask installed. If not, install it using `pip install flask`.
5. Execute `python app.py` to start the application.

Now, you can access the Stadium Management System through your web browser.
